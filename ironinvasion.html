        <div class = "description">
            <p>During studies I was a programmer in a team of students making a third person multiplayer shooter. The game was published on the Core platform, and we maintained the project for some time after publishing.</p>
            <p>My responsibility during development was mainly enemy AI, networking and optimization. After publishing I made sure the game was running smoothly with a lot of players online and servers running long periods of time.</p>
